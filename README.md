# Selection-Merge-Sort-
This code reads a file (the sample file is given in a phonebook format) and sorts the data two separate ways (Selection sort and Merge Sort). The code includes a UI to select which sorting method the user would like to choose, with each sorting method running on a different thread. The code is fully written in Java.
